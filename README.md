Problem Statement:
This study is done to establish an association between sites that have bulk storage of hazardous waste and incidences of cancer in New York state. We consider three different types of bulk storage facilities namely Petroleum Bulk Storage, Chemical Bulk Storage and Major Oil Bulk Storage. These facilities are required by the law to safely manage the waste they generate, so as to ensure that no damage is caused to the environment and the community. The Environment Protection Agency (EPA) and New York State Conservation Department (NYSDEC) are tasked with inspecting these facilities every year to ensure that these facilities follow proper laws and guidelines.

Methodology:
The objective of the study is to overlay the data points from the Bulk Storage Facilities data and the Cancer incidence data, to establish an associative relationship between counties with high hazardous waste storage facilities and the incidence of cancer rates in that county, during the period of 2010. Furthermore, this is compared with the data that indicates the percentage of the population having income below the poverty line, to ascertain the disparity in cancer incidences and locations of chemical facilities across different socio economic groups. 

Results:
We observe in these maps that high cancer incidence counts are in counties that have clusters of Chemical, Petroleum and Major Oil Bulk Storage Facilities. This can be observed by switching on and off the different layers. We also see that there is a higher count of Population under the Poverty Line in the same counties. So the people residing in these communities also donâ€™t have the access to resources to remedy their situations. We believe both these data sets should be used in deciding which facilities should be inspected every year.
